  -------------------------------------------------------------
  1) This shows a live human Heartbeat Pulse.
  2) Live visualization in Arduino's Cool "Serial Plotter".
  3) Blink an LED on each Heartbeat.
  4) This is the direct Pulse Sensor's Signal.
  5) A great first-step in troubleshooting your circuit and connections.
  6) "Human-readable" code that is newbie friendly."
  7) Connect your sensor as described below.
  8) Of course, please connect your Arduino compatible board to your computer.
  9) Upload this sketch, if you feel like it. :)
  10) Select "Serial Plotter" from "Tools" in your Arduino softwares menu.

//  Variables
const int pulseSensorPin = 0;        // Pulse Sensor signal (S) wire connected to ANALOG PIN 0 (A0)
int sensorVal;                       // Holds the incoming raw data. Signal value can range from 0-1024
int threshold = 600;                 // If sensor value exceeds this value, we detect a beat.


float sinAngle;

// The SetUp Function:
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);     // Setting pin of built in LED as output to be able to turn it on or off.
  Serial.begin(9600);            // Set's up Serial Communication at certain speed.
}

// The Main Loop Function
void loop() {

  sensorVal = analogRead(pulseSensorPin);  // Read the PulseSensor's value.
//  sinAngle = sinAngle + 0.01;
//  sensorVal = (sin(sinAngle) + 1) / 2 * 1023; // Fake sensor value (if u don't have a sensor..)
  // Assign this value to the "Signal" variable.

  Serial.println(sensorVal);                    // Send the signal value to Serial Plotter.

  if (sensorVal > threshold) {                      // If the signal is above threshold, then turn on LED.
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);               //  Else, the signal must be below threshold, so turn off this LED.
  }
